          Two DxE activists in North Carolina were charged with multiple
          felonies for investigating a Smithfield pig farm and rescuing two sick
          piglets. They exposed rampant drug use, antibiotic-resistant diseases,
          and the companyâ€™s continued use of cruel gestation crates. Their
          investigation findings generated national media coverage in The New
          York Times and Vox. Arwen and Sierra appeared in court in November
          2019, and Sierra got out of the case. She was offered a deal without
          charges if she named everyone involved in the investigation and rescue
          at Smithfield, but she refused. She ended up with misdemeanor charges
          and community service. Arwen was continuing to trial, but in 2021, she
          was offered a greatly reduced plea deal with only 2 misdemeanor
          charges and community service. Arwen took the plea deal and pled
          guilty to misdemeanor breaking and entering and misdemeanor trespass
          on March 24, 2021.
