          DxE SF Bay Area investigated Diestel Turkey Ranch, a Whole Foods
          supplier at the highest GAP welfare rating, in 2015 and filed suit in
          2017 for consumer fraud. The case went to trial in October – December
          2019. The judge who presided over the 2019 trial left the bench for
          medical leave before rendering a decision. The case was then
          reassigned to a new judge who issued a decision in November 2020
          without the benefit of seeing any of the witnesses or hearing any of
          the testimony. The new judge nevertheless concluded that: “Plaintiff
          cannot establish actual reliance under the law if from the outset its
          agents already strongly suspected that the defendant’s advertising was
          false and were not deceived by it... Although it appears dubious that
          Diestel is a ‘small’ family farm or that its birds receive
          ‘individual’ care or live ‘twice as long’ as other commercial turkeys,
          because plaintiff lacks standing, this court is without jurisdiction
          to adjudicate those claims.” DxE SF Bay Area appealed this decision in
          January 2021. The appeal is pending. Separately, consumers who
          purchased Diestel’s turkey products also sued Diestel Turkey Ranch for
          consumer fraud in 2020. Cases are pending in both California and New
          Mexico. More information is available by contacting counsel at <a
