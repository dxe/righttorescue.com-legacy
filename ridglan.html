          Ridglan Farms is a dog breeding and research facility in Wisconsin
          that raises beagles for cruel experiments. A few years ago, DxE
          investigators entered the facility and documented the filthy
          conditions and the psychological trauma of the dogs spinning endlessly
          inside small cages. The team rescued three beagles. Although the
          investigation and rescue happened years ago, the charging documents
          were filed in August 2021. No hearing dates have been set yet, but our
          legal team is working on the case. This is an important opportunity to
          show the world the horrors inflicted on humankindâ€™s supposed best
          friend and to move toward ending experimentation on dogs and other
          animals.
