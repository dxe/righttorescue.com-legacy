        <p>
          Over 100 nonviolent activists have been arrested at factory farms in
          Sonoma County for taking direct action to help suffering animals after
          the government ignored repeated reports of criminal animal cruelty.
          Thirteen activists face criminal charges, including a total of 47
          felonies. Trial was expected to begin in 2020, but the COVID-19
          pandemic delayed the court schedule. Four felony defendants have
          preliminary hearings set for November 2021, and two felony defendants have
          preliminary hearings set for January 2022.
