    Case dismissed! The felony case against Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin
    Picklesimer for rescuing turkeys from a Utah farm in 2017 was just dismissed
    because the company and prosecutor agreed that "the criminalization of this
    nonviolent investigation and rescue is unnecessary." This is a step toward
    the #RightToRescue! Please share this important news on

    We got a new case! Eva Hamer, Paul Darwin Picklesimer, and Wayne Hsiung were
    charged for rescuing three beagles from Ridglan Farms, a massive breeding
    and research facility that raises beagles for horrific experiments like
    force-feeding them laundry detergent until they vomit blood and die. The
    defendants believe the public will support their actions in saving these
    dogs.

    of an Iowa Select Farm during the campaign to end the use of "ventilation

    Sierra is out of the Smithfield case in North Carolina. She was offered a
    deal without charges if she named everyone involved in the investigation,
    but she refused. She ended up with misdemeanor charges and community
    service. Arwen is continuing with the case.
