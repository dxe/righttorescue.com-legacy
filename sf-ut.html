          In 2017, activists rescued two piglets, Lily and Lizzie, from a Utah
          factory farm owned by Smithfield Foods, the largest pig-killing
          company in the world. Their story went viral when the FBI started
          hunting for the piglets, raiding sanctuaries and even cutting off part
          of a pigâ€™s ear to do DNA testing. Two of the rescuers are facing 60
          years in prison. Their trial was delayed due to the pandemic but it
          could happen in 2021.
