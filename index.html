          We, the undersigned, write to demand immediate action to rectify the
          abuses of the factory farming industry around the world, and protect
          whistleblowers who expose this misconduct and help the suffering
          animals.

          <p>
            The toll of factory farming is beyond doubt. Industrial animal farms
            are one of the largest causes of climate change and habitat loss.
            They contribute to serious public health risks, including antibiotic
            resistance that sickens and kills young children. And they inflict
            grotesque cruelty on billions of sentient beings. Polling data shows
            that an overwhelming 97% of the US public believes that animals need
            some legal protection from exploitation, and 49% believes factory
            farms should be outright banned. These numbers increase every year,
            which is why leading political commentators and philosophers have
            described animal rights as the next frontier of social justice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet far from supporting progress, our political and corporate
            leaders have too often blocked it. Nationwide, the industry receives
            billions of dollars in subsidies -- including corporate welfare for
            millionaires. Government-established price controls gouge consumers,
            especially those who are in most need, and deceptive corporate
            marketing manipulates us into taking actions against our own values.
            Laws have been passed to prohibit competition in the market by
            plant-based alternatives. And perhaps most frighteningly, our most
            basic civil liberties have been undermined -- and over 120
            nonviolent activists and whistleblowers have been arrested on felony
            charges and threatened with prison -- for exposing the industryâ€™s
            misconduct and trying to help suffering animals.
          </p>

          <p>
            The devastating toll of this industry -- on the planet, on our
            citizens, and on animals -- demands action. We are calling for an
            immediate end to the government support of factory farming abuses
            and the draconian prosecutions of nonviolent activists. And at the
            heart of this issue, we demand legal protection for animals,
            including the legal right of all animals to be rescued from
            situations of distress and exploitation.

            We got a new case! Eva Hamer, Paul Darwin Picklesimer, and Wayne
            Hsiung were charged for rescuing three beagles from Ridglan Farms, a
            massive breeding and research facility that raises beagles for
            horrific experiments like force-feeding them laundry detergent until
            they vomit blood and die. The defendants believe the public will
            support their actions in saving these dogs.

            fence of an Iowa Select Farm during the campaign to end the use of

            avoid taking the stand in court.

            The owner of the Norbest Turkey farm DxE investigated just released
            20 turkeys to DxE activists days before Thanksgiving, for the second
            year in a row! He has condemned the prosecution that DxE
            investigators are facing and he is actively helping us rescue more
            animals. See the video at

            Sierra is out of the Smithfield case in North Carolina. She was
            offered a deal without charges if she named everyone involved in the
            investigation, but she refused. She ended up with misdemeanor
            charges and community service. Arwen is continuing with the case.
