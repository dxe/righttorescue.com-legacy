          DxE investigators documented cannibalism, infections, and death inside
          Pleasant Valley Farms, a Costco “cage-free” egg farm. Now, two
          investigators are being charged over $330,000 in restitution. Costco
          claims to give animals 5 freedoms, including freedom from pain and
          suffering, and the company received widespread public praise for
          committing to selling only cage-free eggs. But DxE’s exposé showed the
          world the horrific reality behind the “cage-free” label, in the
          Washington Post, New York Times and more. We have appealed the court's
          decision, but the Superior Court of California, County of San Joaquin,
          Appellate Division rejected our appeal by affirming the judge's
          original decision. We have petitioned to transfer the case to the
          Court of Appeal to see if they will hear it. In this case, the Court
          of Appeal's role is similar to that of the Supreme Court in that it
          has discretion to choose what cases to take.
