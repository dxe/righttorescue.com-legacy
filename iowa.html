          With help from employee whistleblowers, DxE exposed Iowa Select Farms
          roasting pigs alive. It’s a process the industry calls “ventilation
          shutdown” (VSD). It was used to kill thousands of healthy pigs in
          response to slaughterhouse shutdowns caused by COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Using hidden cameras, DxE captured pigs shrieking in agony at
          temperatures of over 140ºF in these gruesome mass killings. Two to
          three hours into the process, workers with bolt guns were seen
          shooting any pigs that appeared to still be alive.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          DxE activists rescued one piglet, named her Gilly, and brought her to
          sanctuary to live out her life in peace. Investigators Matt Johnson
          and Linda Cridge are facing felony burglary charges because of Gilly's
          rescue. Matt is also being charged under Iowa's third "ag gag" law for
          "food operation trespass." He is the first person to be charged under
          the law. Matt's felony trial is currently set for December 2, 2021.
          Linda's felony trial is currently set for December 16, 2021.

            Matt was born and raised in Cresco, Iowa. He earned his B.A. in

            in the National Guard before becoming an activist with DxE. He has
            family members who are pig farmers and believes that even in rural
            Iowa, people want to see a world where all animals are protected
            under the law.
