            DxE exposed Iowa's largest “pork” producer using a gruesome mass
            kill method called “ventilation shutdown” (VSD).
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Thousands of pigs were loaded into a shed, the vents were sealed
            off, and heat and steam were pumped inside to kill them. With the
            help of an employee whistleblower who was sickened by the cruelty,
            DxE investigators captured hidden-camera video of the pigs screaming
            in agony for hours as they died. They also rescued a piglet and
            named her Gilly.

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4>Brutality like this is the result of a corrupt food system.</h4>
          <p class="mt-3">
            The USDA is handing out millions of dollars to make up for the
            profit companies lost from killing off their animals during the
            pandemic. A producer like Iowa Select Farms can get hundreds of
            dollars for every pig they killed and threw away.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Instead of prosecuting the horrific animal cruelty at Iowa Select
            Farms, the state of Iowa came after the whistleblowers who exposed
            it. In direct response to DxE’s investigations, the governor has
            signed a series of “ag-gag” bills into law to protect the industry
            from public scrutiny. Matt Johnson is the first person to be charged
            under the new law, which was enacted less than two weeks after the
            release of DxE’s exposé.

          <h4>
            The COVID-19 crisis put a spotlight on the horrors of animal
            agriculture.
          </h4>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Now more than ever, the world is paying attention to the reality of
            animal agriculture, from diseases brewing inside factory farms, to
            the routine endangerment of slaughterhouse workers, to “ventilation
            shutdown” – the epitome of this industry’s disregard for life.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            While the industry thinks they’re putting whistleblowers on trial,
            the tables are being turned to put the industry on trial instead.
            Activists and journalists are uniting in Iowa for this
            groundbreaking case. We will show the public what the industry and
            government are trying so hard to hide.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            A victory in court could challenge the constitutionality of ag-gag
            laws and establish a precedent for a new wave of anti-ag-gag
            legislation. Imagine if instead of covering up animal cruelty, our
            laws gave ordinary people the right to see inside these places, and
            even rescue sick and suffering animals. With the victory of this
            case, a chain reaction will be set to end ag-gag and enshrine the
            Right to Rescue.
